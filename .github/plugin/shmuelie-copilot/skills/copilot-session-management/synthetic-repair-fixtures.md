# Synthetic repair fixtures for session integrity

These fixtures are **fictional**. They are not copied from any real Copilot CLI
session and they do not claim to represent a stable published event schema.
They are small, line-oriented models for reasoning about safe repair behavior.

Use them only to answer questions like "what is the safest disposition when a
log is truncated or references dangle?" Do **not** replay them into real user
session folders.

## Fixture 1 - Missing result after a request

```json
{"line":1,"sessionId":"S-001","eventId":"evt-1","kind":"user","timestamp":"2026-08-01T10:00:00Z","text":"Run the tests"}
{"line":2,"sessionId":"S-001","eventId":"evt-2","kind":"toolRequest","requestId":"req-7","tool":"powershell","timestamp":"2026-08-01T10:00:01Z","command":"dotnet test"}
{"line":3,"sessionId":"S-001","eventId":"evt-3","kind":"assistant","timestamp":"2026-08-01T10:00:02Z","text":"Waiting for test output"}
{"line":4,"sessionId":"S-001","eventId":"evt-4","kind":"toolResult","requestId":
```

**Expected diagnostic:** trailing JSON is truncated, and the final visible
request/result pair is incomplete.

**Safe disposition:** back up first, then repair or remove only the truncated
tail line if the file is otherwise valid. Keep `req-7` as an interrupted
request unless you have the real result from a verified backup. Never invent a
successful `toolResult`.

## Fixture 2 - Equal timestamps must keep original order

```json
{"line":11,"sessionId":"S-002","eventId":"evt-10","kind":"toolRequest","requestId":"req-9","timestamp":"2026-08-01T10:05:00.000Z","tool":"rg","pattern":"TODO"}
{"line":12,"sessionId":"S-002","eventId":"evt-11","kind":"toolResult","requestId":"req-9","timestamp":"2026-08-01T10:05:00.000Z","exitCode":0}
{"line":13,"sessionId":"S-002","eventId":"evt-12","kind":"assistant","timestamp":"2026-08-01T10:05:00.000Z","text":"No matches found"}
```

**Expected diagnostic:** timestamps alone are not enough to reconstruct
causality because all three records are equal.

**Safe disposition:** preserve the original line order. Do not sort or
reserialize the file just to make timestamps "look ordered."

## Fixture 3 - Interleaved records from different sessions

```json
{"line":20,"sessionId":"S-100","eventId":"evt-20","kind":"user","timestamp":"2026-08-01T11:00:00Z","text":"Fix build break"}
{"line":21,"sessionId":"S-200","eventId":"evt-88","kind":"user","timestamp":"2026-08-01T11:00:00Z","text":"Summarize PR"}
{"line":22,"sessionId":"S-100","eventId":"evt-21","kind":"toolRequest","requestId":"req-1","timestamp":"2026-08-01T11:00:01Z","tool":"powershell","command":"dotnet build"}
{"line":23,"sessionId":"S-200","eventId":"evt-89","kind":"assistant","timestamp":"2026-08-01T11:00:01Z","text":"Reviewing pull request"}
```

**Expected diagnostic:** the file contains cross-session interleaving, so a
global timestamp sort cannot safely recover either conversation.

**Safe disposition:** do not merge or reorder the sessions into one synthetic
stream. Split or restore from backup by session identity, or abandon manual
repair if the version-specific ownership rules are unclear.

## Fixture 4 - Dangling reference after removal or compaction

```json
{"line":30,"sessionId":"S-300","eventId":"evt-30","kind":"assistant","timestamp":"2026-08-01T12:00:00Z","text":"Created repair plan"}
{"line":31,"sessionId":"S-300","eventId":"evt-31","kind":"checkpoint","checkpointId":"cp-1","references":["evt-30","evt-32"],"timestamp":"2026-08-01T12:00:01Z"}
{"line":32,"sessionId":"S-300","eventId":"evt-32","kind":"assistant","timestamp":"2026-08-01T12:00:02Z","text":"Will compact history now"}
```

Assume `evt-32` is removed during compaction without updating `cp-1`.

**Expected diagnostic:** `cp-1` now points to a missing record, so the repair
introduced a dangling cross-reference.

**Safe disposition:** restore the missing record from backup, or remove/repair
the checkpoint only if the current CLI version clearly documents that reference
format. If the schema is unknown, stop instead of guessing.
